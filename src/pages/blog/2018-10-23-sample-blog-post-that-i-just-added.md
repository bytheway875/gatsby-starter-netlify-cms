  Wow, you must be rich. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've
  been planning it for two weeks. It's cold, damn cold. Ha, ha, ha, Einstein,
  you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's
  still ticking. George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a
  man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman
  he loves. Don't you? Uh, coast guard.

Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty. But, what are you blind McFly, it's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there? Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it. Safe now, everything's let lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series.



Yoo. Thanks. Right check, Doc. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf. No, fine, no , good, fine, good.
